LEVEL_START => Player start the game
    - LEVEL_START (event)
---------------
COIN_GEN => Coin shape spawns
    - COIN_GEN (event)
    - shape (shape)
    - int (coins) => # of coins generated.
---------------
FIRST_COIN => First coin taken (Timeout for 5 seconds to avoid spamming this)
    - FIRST_COIN (event)
    - shape (shape)
    - int(num_objs) ⇒ # of moving objects on the screen when the coin is taken.
---------------
COIN_OUT => Coin shape leaves the screen
    - COIN_OUT (event)
    - int(coins) ⇒ # of coins
---------------
HIT=> got hit by obstacle
    - HIT (event)
    - asteroid/planet/satellite (object)
    - int(num_objs) ⇒ # of moving objects on the screen when dead.
---------------
LEVEL_COMPLETE => Player finish the level 
    - LEVEL_COMPLETE (event)
    - int (distance) ⇒ distance covered
---------------

Analysis:
    I would like to capture % of coins gained and # of moving objects on the screen along with the distance they have covered. 

Transform/score:
    Score ~ distance* coin (%) * num_objs when HIT
Each of the scores would be z scored based on distribution and their distance to origin in proportion to maximal distance. 
score: normal distribution
coin(%): 1-rayleigh
num_objs: normal distribution
